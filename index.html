            <p>My concerns is, I will lose interest or get to a point wehre I'm not understanding that I end up drifting after putting in a lot of my time. When it comes to not knowing, I'm not affraid to not know something because you can always learn. Its the keeping up with it and having the time to expand my knowledge and skill far enough to make it a career. </p>

            <h2>Every card has a title</h2>

                <p> A card is a simple unit of imformation. We'll use the <artile> tag to represent a card and then style it with css. </p>
                <p>This card has a <b>paragraph</b> of <span class="red-text">text</span> with a <a href="www.portlandcodeschool.com">link.</a> It also has a second <span class="sentence">sentence</span> of <b>text</b> with a <a href="www.portlandcodeschool.com">link.</a>

                <p>
                    <b>But</b>
                    we never use pixels ("px") to determine the size of a card.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We use measurement to
                    <em>flex</em>
                    , like percents (%) or that relate to the size of the content, like
                    <em>root</em>
                    "em" units (rem), which relate the size of the element tot he text size and thus make the card readable.
